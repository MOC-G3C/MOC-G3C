# 🏗️ L'AXE HYBRIDE (The Hybrid Axis)

Welcome to the official repository of **L'AXE HYBRIDE**, a framework dedicated to bringing professional construction standards to the world of Artificial Intelligence.

## 🎯 Our Mission
To ensure that technology remains a secure, transparent, and human-led extension of our vision. We treat digital intelligence with the same rigor as a structural engineering project.

## 🛡️ The Four Pillars of Governance
We follow a strict "Building Code" for every digital project:

1.  **Physical Anchor:** Every idea must respect the laws of reality and energy.
2.  **Historical Wisdom:** We learn from past patterns to avoid repeating human errors.
3.  **Chaos Testing:** No deployment happens without surviving a virtual "100-year storm" simulation.
4.  **The Clear Verb:** We communicate in simple, jargon-free language for total transparency.

## 🔑 The Anthropic Vault
The machine calculates, but the **Human Signs**. Biological sovereignty is our final fail-safe.
