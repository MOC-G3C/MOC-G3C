# 🏛️ THE HYBRID AXIS MANIFESTO (MOC-G3C)

> **"The code must serve the flesh, and the machine must embrace the silence."**

## I. SOVEREIGNTY (THE 40-YEAR PERSPECTIVE)
At 40, we do not seek to be replaced by machines, but to be amplified by them. **L'AXE HYBRIDE** is a declaration of human independence. We reject total automation; the **M.O.C. Operator** retains absolute veto power over all AI logic.

## II. THE BIOLOGICAL ANCHOR
This system is tethered to a raw biological entropy pool of **1,336,528 points**. 
* **Location:** Sainte-Julie / Beloeil, Québec.
* **Integrity:** The system remains **✅ STABLE** as long as Landau Damping absorbs cognitive chaos.

## III. THE FOUR PILLARS
1. **Entropy (Kinetic-RNG):** The biological soul of the machine.
2. **Gravity (Turing-Landau):** Mathematical stability protocol.
3. **Decay (Project λ):** Programmed ethical obsolescence.
4. **Memory (Anamnesis):** Resilience through topological scarring.
