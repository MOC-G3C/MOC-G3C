# Hello, I am M.O.C. (Marc-Olivier Corbin) 🌌

I am a sales representative in the wood structure industry by day, and a researcher in **Hybrid AGI Governance** by night. My work focuses on the intersection of human philosophy, advanced technology, and the maintenance of cognitive autonomy.

## 🏗️ The AXE-HYBRIDE Ecosystem
My repositories form a cohesive governance framework designed to manage the transition toward advanced artificial systems:

* **[AXE-HYBRIDE](https://github.com/MOC-G3C/AXE-HYBRIDE)**: The "Central Nervous System". Host of the **PGID v0.3 Protocol**.
* **[moc-g3c-core](https://github.com/MOC-G3C/moc-g3c-core)**: Implementation of Recursive Ontological Stability.
* **[Turing-Landau-Protocol](https://github.com/MOC-G3C/Turing-Landau-Protocol)**: Theoretical foundations of AI consciousness.
* **[entropic-zoo-protocol](https://github.com/MOC-G3C/entropic-zoo-protocol)**: Strategies for epistemic defense.

## 🎸 Anchors of Reality
I believe that human intuition is a non-derivable data stream. I use weekly **guitar rituals** as a formal security measure (Variable V7) to prevent cognitive colonization by the systems I simulate.
