# 👨‍💻 I am MOC-G3C (Marc-Olivier Corbin)

**AI Governance Architect | Timber Structure Specialist | Semantic Arbiter**

Based in **Beloeil, Quebec**, I bridge the gap between advanced AI orchestration and physical engineering.

## 🏗 The Hybrid Axis (MOC-G3C)
I am the lead architect of the **Hybrid Axis**, a collaborative framework designed to govern multiple AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT-4) through strict human arbitration.

### 🛡 Core Projects
* **[Janus-Gateway](https://github.com/MOC-G3C/Janus-Gateway)**: An adversarial testing framework implementing **Protocol λ v1.1** to prevent semantic drift and ensure structural integrity.
* **Turing-Landau-Protocol**: A physics-inspired approach to persistent AI memory and consciousness detection.
* **Kybernetes-Governance**: Formal specifications for human-centric AI control systems.

## ⚖️ My Philosophy: The Human Firewall
> "The machine proposes, the Human disposes."

I believe that AI security must be enforced through **architectural constraints** rather than values. My work focuses on:
* **Mathematical Trust**: $\text{Trust}(S) \iff \forall t, \text{Audit}(S, t)$.
* **Structural Reality**: Anchoring AI logic into physical laws (Timber, Snow Loads, Physics).
* **The 3-6-9 Principle**: Exploring the non-linear significance of Tesla’s universal constants in logic systems.
